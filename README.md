# Vender-Machine
Write a JAVA program or library that simulates a vending machine with the following features:<br>
The implementation should track current stock levels of the machine.<br>
The interface should include methods to restock the machine and to purchase an item.<br>
When a purchase is made, the machine should dispense the correct change (including the number and denomination of each coin).<br><br>

Assume the machine holds enough coins and currency that it won’t run out of change. You only need to support a single currency, but choose denominations such that the machine can dispense at least 6 different coins or notes (e.g. 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 in Sterling, or 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ coins and $1 and $5 notes in USD).
<br><br>The implementation should be capable of dispensing at least five distinct products (that is, the user should be able to choose from at least 5 different options).
